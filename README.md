### Standards and EIPs

- [EIP-712 — Typed Structured Data Hashing and Signing](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712): canonical typed signing used by modern wallets.
- [EIP-2612 — permit for ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612): approvals via signatures; often complementary to authorization-based flows.
- [ERC-4337 — Account Abstraction (AA)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337): smart account architecture that pairs well with authorization patterns.

#### Extensions
- [ERC-3009 Forwarding](https://github.com/TheGreatAxios/eip3009-forwarder): forwarding contract extending meta-transactions with EIP-721 signatures to any ERC-20 on any network
